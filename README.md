# JSCustomerAction

This project contains a custom JavaScript GitHub Action that generates a random password of length 1. The password is guaranteed to be either a letter, a number, or a special character, ensuring it meets the minimum requirements for complexity. The action can be used in workflows to generate and output a single-character password.
